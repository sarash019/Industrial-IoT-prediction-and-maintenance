## Overview

This IoT Predictive Maintenance System is designed to monitor sensor data from connected devices, predict potential failures, and alert users before a breakdown occurs. The pipeline:
1. Simulates sensor data and streams it to Kafka.
2. Processes data in real-time with Spark.
3. Connects to AWS IoT Core for device management.
4. Uses machine learning models for predictive analytics, tracking experiments and versions with MLflow.


## Key Components

### AWS IoT Integration

The AWS IoT Core configuration (aws_iot_config.json) enables cloud connectivity for managing IoT devices and sending/receiving data securely. This part supports real-time data management and monitoring through AWS's secure infrastructure.

**Kafka Streaming**
The kafka_producer.py script generates and streams simulated sensor data (e.g., temperature, vibration, pressure) to a Kafka topic. Kafka serves as the data backbone for processing and analytics, enabling scalable and real-time data handling.

### Data Preprocessing

The preprocess_data.py script cleans and prepares raw data, making it suitable for model training. Preprocessing steps include:

**Missing value handling:** Removes or imputes missing data.
**Scaling:** Standardizes data for consistent model performance.
**Feature engineering:** Adds or transforms features based on analysis requirements.

### Machine Learning with MLflow
The mlflow_experiment.py script handles model training, tracking, and version control with MLflow. Key features include:

**Experiment logging:** Tracks model parameters, metrics, and training details.
**Model registry:** Saves models in MLflow for easy retrieval and deployment.
**Hyperparameter management:** Uses configurations from model_config.yaml for model consistency and reproducibility.

## Setup Instructions

### Requirements
Ensure you have the following installed:

**Python 3.8+**
**Kafka (locally or a Kafka cluster)**
**Spark for distributed processing**
**MLflow for experiment tracking**

### Configuration

1. Clone the Repository:


           git clone https://github.com/karimosman89/iot-predictive-maintenance.git
   
           cd iot-predictive-maintenance

3. Install Dependencies:


             pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Configure Services:

Update the aws_iot_config.json file with AWS IoT Core details.
Modify the configs/kafka_config.yaml and configs/spark_config.yaml to match your Kafka and Spark environments.
Set model parameters in configs/model_config.yaml for training and evaluation.


## Usage
1. Start Kafka Producer: Run the kafka_producer.py script to start streaming sensor data to Kafka.


             python scripts/kafka_producer.py

2. Preprocess Data: After gathering sufficient data, preprocess it for model training.


            python scripts/preprocess_data.py

3. Run MLflow Experiment: Use the mlflow_experiment.py script to train and log the model.


            python scripts/mlflow_experiment.py

Check your MLflow UI at http://localhost:5000 (or configured port) to view experiment results.
